# PMC-text-mining
  
The aim of this project is to use the text from biomedical and life science literature to gain insights on research topic trends over time. The data is extracted from the [text mining collections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/textmining/) made available by the [PubMed Central (PMC) archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/), an archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine. Through [dynamic topic modeling](https://github.com/blei-lab/dtm), I have discovered the underlying themes of the text collections and observed some interesting changes over time. This method offers new ways to automatically organize, search, index, and browse large document collections.
  
This is my Capstone project for the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly (Washington, DC).
