    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "The aim of this project was to use the text from biomedical and life science literature to gain insights on research topic trends over time. The data was extracted from the [text mining collections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/textmining/) made available by the [PubMed Central (PMC) archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/), an archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine. Through dynamic topic modeling, I discovered the underlying themes of the text collections and observed some interesting changes over time. This method offers new ways to automatically organize, search, index, and browse large document collections."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The explosion of electronic document archives has allowed us to explore such collections like never before; the sheer volumes of the documents has also presented immense challenges. I sought to use machine learning tools to discover the underlying themes in the biomedical and life science literature as well as their trends over time."

    "## Methods and Results\n",
    "The data was obtained from a subset of the [PubMed Central (PMC) archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/), an archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine, which is made [freely available](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/textmining/) to the public under a Creative Commons or similar license. This subset contains over 1 millions articles. Specifically, for each article, meta data (such as publication year, journal title, etc.) and content (article title and abstract) were extracted from the corresponding XML file. Natural Language Processing technique was used to extract text features from the article titles and abstracts. The text was then analyzed by dynamic topic modeling, which captures the evolution of topics in a sequentially organized corpus of documents.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As a proof of concept, I analyzed 23,896 articles from [_The Journal of Cell Biology_](http://jcb.rupress.org/) from 1962 through present (2017). The corpus is made up of approximately 2.2 million words. The vocabulary was pruned by \"[lemmatizing](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.html#nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer)\", removing stop words, and removing terms that occurred fewer than 20 times. The total vocabulary size is 6,619. To explore the themes in the collection, I estimated a 10-component dynamic topic model. A few  of the resulting topics are illustrated in detail [below](#Process-output).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I also analyzed a collection from _The Journal of Experimental Medicine_, which is detailed [here](jem_9topics.ipynb)."

    "## Interpretation of Results\n",
    "The 10 resulting topics can be roughly summarized as:\n",
    "0. cytoskeletal systems\n",
    "1. inter-cell communications\n",
    "2. nucleus, cell replications and cycles\n",
    "3. inter- and intra-cell transport\n",
    "4. neuroscience\n",
    "5. cell signaling\n",
    "6. imaging techniques (esp. microscopy)\n",
    "7. gene transcription and translation\n",
    "8. cell/tissue cultures, cancer research\n",
    "9. mitochondria\n",
    "  \n",
    "This appears to be a comprehensive high-level list of topics in cell biology. \n",
    "\n",
    "A closer took at the key terms in some of these topics revealed some interesting (although maybe not so surprising) trends in research. For example, within the \"nucleus and cell cycles\" topic, the term \"microtubule\" peaked in the 1980s, \"nucleus\" has been on decline since 1970s, and new entities such \"kinetochore\" and \"assembly\" are on the rise. As another example, within the \"cell/tissue cultures & cancer research\" topic, \n",
    "\"culture\" has been on the decline since 1980s, while \"stem\" (presumably as in \"stem cell\") and \"cancer\" are on the rise since 1990s."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Dynamic topic modeling technique has been shown to be a powerful tool for organizing and exploring a large collection of text documents. When applied to biomedical and life science literature, it can aid researchers and curious laypersons alike to discover interesting themes and trends."

    "## Recommendations / Next Steps\n",
    "The analysis can be extended to the whole text mining collections from PMC; it can also be extended to the full text of the articles. In addition, the text extraction procedure can be further scrutinized for optimization (cleaner text, less missing information, etc.). In regard to domain-specific terms, efforts can be made to build up stop word collection, as well as to improve the stemming procedures, for the purpose of further pruning the vocabulary. Lastly, it would be interesting to compare the results from the dynamic topic models with those from other topic models such as `gensim`'s LDA module."
